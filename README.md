# nhd_search

A web interface to search the [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov/) - a database of nearly every lake, pond, stream, river, canal, dam and stream gage in the United States.

This interface should be especially helpful for those looking to match existing data to the appropriate entry in the NHD. E.g. given a lattitude, longitude and name of a river, which river is this likely to be in the NHD?

## Status

Beta / work in progress. Only flowlines (streams, rivers, etc.) supported at this time.
