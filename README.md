# nhd_search

A web interface to search the [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov/) - a database of every river in the United States.

This interface should be especially helpful for those looking to match existing river data to the appropriate entry in the NHD. E.g. given a lattitude, longitude and name of a river, which river is this likely to be in the NHD?
