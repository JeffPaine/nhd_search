## About

`nhd_search` is simple a web interface for searching the [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov/) - a database of nearly every lake, pond, stream, river, canal, dam and stream gauge in the United States.

This interface should be helpful for those who would like to search the NHD dataset but have limited access to GIS software or knowledge. `nhd_search` is especially useful for linking existing geo data to the respective feature entry in the NHD. E.g. given a lattitude, longitude and name of a river, which river is this likely to be in the NHD?

## Status

Alpha / work in progress. Only flowlines (streams, rivers, etc.) supported at this time.
