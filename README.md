# nhd_search

A web interface to search the [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov/) - a database of nearly every lake, pond, stream, river, canal, dam and stream gage in the United States.

This interface should be helpful for those looking to match feature geo data to the feature's respective entry in the NHD. E.g. given a lattitude, longitude and name of a river, which river is this likely to be in the NHD?

## Status

Alpha / work in progress. Only flowlines (streams, rivers, etc.) supported at this time.
